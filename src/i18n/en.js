  educationTitle: `Education`,
  educationText: `Unfortunately, education in Kibera is not a priority for the government or the families. Education is expensive and they simply can’t afford it. We want our kids to have access to a quality education system, and with your help we support their path from basic education to university. We cover expenses with tuitions and fees, school supplies, uniforms, field trips, accommodation, transportation, and food.`,
  activitiesTitle: `Extracurricular activities`,

  activitiesTextOne: `To ensure the children we support get a chance at success, besides funding their education we also take them in at our Support Center in Kibera during their free time, school holidays, and vacations. We provide them with individual school support, and extra-curricular activities like ballet classes, karate, swimming, soccer, gymnastics, and computer classes.`,
  activitiesTextTwo: `We also host many special moments: the Science Academy, where kids learn chemistry through experiments; the Arts Club, where they express themselves through painting, scrapbooking, reading, and cinema; the Hour of the Planet where we teach about recycling, preserving nature, and cleaning the environment; or the Debate Group where they learn about and discuss questions fundamental for their lives as members of society.
We also make sure to celebrate the birthdays of all our kids with a party at the end of each month for all who had their special day during that month.`,

  findusTwo: `For those visiting Kenya, we created a solidary tour to discover Kenya in its true essence. Passing through the main emblematic points of Nairobi, without leaving aside the Elephant Orphanage and Giraffe Center, these unforgettable days also have an authentic visit to Kibera. As it should be, it includes the much-desired African safari with sightseeing of Kilimanjaro and also many dives in the Indian Ocean, without leaving out the historic sites of Mombasa. The best of all is the opportunity of spending a few days in our home, mingling and falling in love with the children we support.  `,
