    From Kibera With Love is a project created by Marta Baeta in January
    2013 with the goal of providing growth opportunities for the children
    of Kibera, one of the world’s biggest slums.
  `,
  home2: `
    In Kenya, having access to education is a luxury that most children
    can’t afford, simply because most of them don’t have a family that can
    ensure their future.
  `,
  home3: `
    Thanks to our friends, acquaintances and strangers who rapidly became
    friends, we are already able to ensure the education of over 100
    children.
